# 9A / 9AJ Heater Helper

This is a simple helper board that makes it easy to wire up a 9-pin tube
socket to work with either 12AX7 / ECC83 or the Russian 6N2P.  The 6N2P
is nearly identical to the 12AX7 except for it's heater configuration and
the presence of an internal shield that needs to be grounded.

This uses one of those small appliance voltage selector switches that are
typically use to connect the incoming mains line cord to either the 120V
or 240V windings of a power tranformer.  I selected this switch because it's
small and has a recessed slider, whic makes it more difficult to change the
setting accidentally.  The particular switch I selected is the C&K V80212MS02Q,
which is readily available from Mouser.  You might find another switch that's
compatible.

Besides the switch, you just need a couple of standard 3-position terminal
blocks and some M3 screws and stand-offs.  The board measures roughly
1.25 inches by 2.25 inches, so it's pretty small and easy to tuck into
the corner of your project.

Enjoy!

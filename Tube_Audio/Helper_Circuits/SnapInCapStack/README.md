# Snap-in Capacitor Stack board

This is a small board that simply makes it easy to stack 2 snap-in capacitors
with load sharing resistors and mount them in an enclosure.  There are + and -
screw terminals, as well as a center-tap terminal, in case that is useful as
a voltage reference.  The resistors installed on the board will of course form
a voltage divider, so as long as you stay within the voltage ratings of the
capacitors installed onto the board, you have some flexibility there.

The board fits 2- and 3-pin snap-in capacitors with 10mm lead spacing, up to
35mm in diameter, and has standard M3 holes for use with screws and stand-offs.

The screw terminal block should be a 3-terminal type, 10.16mm pitch,
Molex 39910-0103 or equivalent (_Mouser part number 538-39910-0103._)
You can, of course, choose to use flying leads if that tickles your
fancy.

# IN-14 Nixie Tube Breakout Board

This is just a simple breakout board to make it easier to play around with IN-14 Nixie tubes
(or any other Nixie that uses the same basic footprint).  Thread the spindly IN-14 lead wires
through the holes and solder it into place.  The arrow on the footprint indicates the anode
lead wire, and corresponds to the arrow on the bottom of the glass.  The R1 resistor footprint
is for the required current-limiting resistor.  For the IN-14s in my stash, I'm using a 180V
supply, and a 47K 1/2W resistor does the job and limits the current to ~1mA (49V drop across
the resistor).  If your power supply is already current-limited, yoiu can just place a jumper
in this position.  Attach some standard 5.04mm pitch screw terminals and some standoffs with #4
machine screws and you're all set.

(I included some old Soviet iconography for fun.)

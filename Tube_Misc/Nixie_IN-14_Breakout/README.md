# IN-14 Nixie Tube Breakout Board

This is just a simple breakout board to make it easier to play around with IN-14 Nixie tubes
(or any other Nixie that uses the same basic footprint).  Thread the spindly IN-14 lead wires
through the holes and solder it into place.  The arrow on the footprint indicates the anode
lead wire, and corresponds to the arrow on the bottom of the glass.  Then attach some standard
5.04mm pitch screw terminals and some standoffs with #4 machine screws and you're all set.

(I included some old Soviet iconography for fun.)
